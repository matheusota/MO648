 * Population.h
 *
 * Encapsulates a population of chromosomes represented by a vector of doubles. We don't decode
 * nor deal with random numbers here; instead, we provide private support methods to set the
 * fitness of a specific chromosome as well as access methods to each allele. Note that the BRKGA
 * class must have access to such methods and thus is a friend.
